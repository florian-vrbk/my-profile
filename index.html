				<h2>~ My Skills ~</h2>
				<p>
					My high school studies and my first months at IESEG allowed me to gain interest in business and marketing. Then, I have pretty good presentation, analysis and communication skills. Even though I have no previous experience in marketing, I have had some associative experiences that helped me to work in team, organize myself and become aware of my responsibilities.

				<h2>~ My Interests ~</h2>
				<p>
					I like listening to music and playing the piano, it helps me to develop my creativity. I am also passionate about travel, because I like to constantly discover new things.

				<h2>~ My Professional Experience ~</h2>
				<p> 
					I had the opportunity to do two observation internships during my schooling. The first took place in a primary school when I was in ninth grade. I analysed the job of a teacher. The second took place in 2019 in an associative lodging where I had the chance to observe the job of specialized educator
